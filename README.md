## Game Description

This is the famous Wordle game that exploded in popularity during the COVID period due to people being cooped up in their living quarters and looking for something interesting, fun and thought-provoking to sustain their attention span. This game was designed and implemented using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, while attending the Software Engineering Bootcamp course at General Assembly.

For a brief history on the inception of Wordle, it was created in 2021 by software engineer Josh Wardle as a personal game for his partner, who loved word games. Despite being shared privately initially, it quickly gained popularity after Wardle released it publicly in October 2021.

## Concept of Wordle/ How to Play

Players shall have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, the game will provide feedback via the guess display and the on-screen keyboard:

- Green tiles indicate that the correct letters are in the correct position
- Yellow means that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position
- Gray signals that the letter isnâ€™t in the word at all.

## Deployment

The game is deployed on GitHub pages, which can be played here: ...

## Summary

As this was my first time creating a project in a very tight timeframe, it was considered extremely ambitious for me to recreate the Tetris game.

However, the idea behind it was that by learning how others recreated the game, I would understand the logic flow behind it and how they linked the HTML, CSS and JS together. This would then allow me to create a game from scratch.

I also learn best by recreating someone's else work, deconstructing it, and then find a better way of going about it.

My philosophy is, "Don't reinvent the wheel. Analyse and observe how the wheel works, the thought process behind creating it, the mechanics of it, and then deconstruct it, and make it better through reconstructing."
